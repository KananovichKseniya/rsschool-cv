### **About myself**
-------------------
After graduation, I worked as a software developer at IBA-Gomel on the project of Electronic Declaration of taxes and fees. My responsibilities included developing XSD schemas, creating and filling out a printed declaration form based on an XML file, writing technical documentation, debugging errors and making changes. 

After the end of the contract, I moved to my husband in Slonim. For a short time I worked as a librarian, at the same time I studied 1C on my own. When a programmer's vacancy opened at the Romgil-Tex enterprise, I went there. I created reports for internal use with printing, serviced the configuration of the software product. 

During my maternity leave, I realized that I would like to try other technologies, and I chose JavaScript.

### **Skills**
--------------
* Java
* XML, XSD
* 1C:Enterprise v8.2

### **Code example from CODEWARE**
----------------------------

Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters. Each night that plant's height decreases by downSpeed meters due to the lack of sun heat. Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.

 ```
 public static int growingPlant(int upSpeed, int downSpeed, int desiredHeight) {
      int countDay = 0;
      int countNight = 0;
      int heightPlant = 0;
      do{
        countDay = countDay + 1;
        heightPlant = heightPlant + upSpeed;
        System.out.println("After day " + countDay +"-->" + heightPlant);
        if (heightPlant<desiredHeight){
          countNight = countNight + 1;
          heightPlant = heightPlant - downSpeed;
          System.out.println("After night " + countNight +"-->" + heightPlant);
        }
      }while (heightPlant<desiredHeight);
        return 1;
    }
